# Infinite Scroll Blog
This is a simple web application that fetches and displays posts from an API, allows users to filter the posts, and loads more posts as the user scrolls down the page. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Fetches posts from an API (in this case, "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts").
- Displays the fetched posts, including the post ID, title, and body.
- Allows users to filter posts based on the input in the filter text box.
- Implements infinite scrolling: more posts are loaded automatically as the user scrolls down the page.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to run the application.

3. The posts will be displayed on the page. You can use the filter input to search for specific posts based on their titles or content.

4. As you scroll down the page, more posts will be loaded automatically.

## Dependencies

This project has no external dependencies as it uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It relies on the following APIs:

- [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) for fetching posts.
